# pythonmicroservices
An example microservice application using Python, Django and PostgreSQL

This code repository is the source code that accompanies my guide on how to create and stand up a simple microservice that uses a PostGreSQL database.  The code can easily be extended to interface with additional services to be used to form an API for web and mobile applications. 

Please feel free to fork the code and use it for your projects!
